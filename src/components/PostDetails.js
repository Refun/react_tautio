                    Netflix)</p>
                <p>Superman himself is set to star as Geralt in Netflix's The Witcher.

                    Henry Cavill is a sight to behold as the streaming site drops its first photo of the star.

                    The teaser shows Cavill on set with silky, silver locks that even Legolas would be jealous of.

                    Based on the best-selling fantasy series, The Witcher tells the tale of Geralt of Rivia, a solitary
                    monster hunter, who
                    struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than beasts.

                    "When destiny hurtles him toward a powerful sorceress, and a young princess with a dangerous
                    secret, the three must
                    learn to navigate the increasingly volatile Continent together," says Netflix.

                    Netflix also confirmed Twin Peaks' Eamon Farren as Cahir and Knightfall's Joey Batey as Jaskier.

                    House of Cards' Lars Mikkelsen as Stregobor, Royce Pierreson as Istredd, Maciej Musiał as Sir
                    Lazlo, Wilson
                    Radjou-Pujalte as Dara, and Harry Potter's Anna Shaffer as Triss.

                    The teaser doesn't show much more than Cavill so we still are in the dark as to what to expec.

                        Anyway, Netflix is pretty deep into production by this point. It’s already cast some series
                        regulars and showrunner
                        Lauren S. Hissrich regularly shares regular updates on her Twitter. Henry Cavill, aka the guy
                        who’s played superman on
                        the big screen for the last five years, is playing Geralt. Today, Netflix showed us what he’ll
                        look like:
                    </div>


                    The official of Station B also said today that "as a US listed company, if we increase capital and
                    expand shares, it
                    will be issued in the form of an announcement. The rumors confirmed without official announcement
                    are not true. Thank
                    you for your concern."

                    <p class="font-weight-bold">
                        Man, they’re even further along than I thought.

                        Cavill wears Geralt’s trademark long white hair pretty well, although he hasn’t got Geralt’s
                        beard. Hopefully that’ll
                        be added there. Cavill’s been a fan of the video games for a while, and has read the books, as
                        well. And he’s British,
                        which is basically required if you’re in a fantasy show.

                        I think this could turn out well! What do you all make of Cavill’s transformation?

                    </p>
                    Under the agreement, Tencent will subscribe for a total of 25,063,451 shares of new shares issued
                    by the B station at a
                    price of US$12.67 per share, valued at approximately US$317.6 million.

                    With the acquisition of Tencent by Tencent, Tencent’s shareholding in B will increase to
                    approximately 12%.</p>
